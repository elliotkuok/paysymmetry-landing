                        <p>You shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Company, its officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that arise from or relate to your use or misuse of, or access to, the Site, Content or otherwise from your Content, violation of the Terms, or infringement by you, or any third party using your account, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity. Company reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will assist and cooperate with Company in asserting any available defenses.</p></li>
                        <li>Limitation of Liability
                        <p>Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights you have which may not be lawfully limited.</p>
                        <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL COMPANY, NOR ITS RELATED ENTITIES, BE LIABLE UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY WITH RESPECT TO THE SITE (I) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, DATA LOSS, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES (HOWEVER ARISING), (II) FOR ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE (REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE OF ORIGINATION), OR (III) FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF (IN THE AGGREGATE) ONE-HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100.00). YOU AGREE THAT OUR SUPPLIERS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
                        <p>FURTHERMORE, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COMPANY, NOR ITS RELATED ENTITIES, BE LIABLE UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE OR AND OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY LOST WAGES, CHANGES IN EMPLOYMENT STATUS, OR OTHER FORSEEABLE OR UNFORSEEABLE EFFECTS OF USING THE SITE.</p></li>
                        <li>Jurisdictional Issues.
                        <p>Accessing the Site is prohibited from territories where such Content is illegal. If you access the Site from other locations, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we make no representation that materials in the Site are appropriate or available for use in all locations.</p>
                        <p>We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Site and/or the provision of any service, program, film, or other product described thereon to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction we so desire, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any such service, program, film, or other product that we provide.</p></li>
                        <li>Notice Policy. 
                        <p>By using the Site, you consent to receive from the Company all communications including notices, agreements, legally required disclosures or other information in connection with the Site (collectively, “Contract Notices”) electronically. The Company may provide such electronic Contract Notices by posting them on the Site. If you desire to withdraw your consent to receive Contract Notices electronically, you must discontinue your use of the Site.</p></li>
                        <li>Arbitration and Governing Law.
                        <p>All controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and Company, including disputes arising out of, under, or related in any way to these Terms or our privacy practices, shall exclusively be settled through binding arbitration.</p>
                        <p>Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). As modified by this Agreement, and unless agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively “Rules and Procedures”).</p>
                        <p>You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under this contract EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.</p>
                        <p>You and the Company must abide by the following rules:</p>
                        <ol class="lower-roman">
                        <li>For any claim that could otherwise be brought in small claims court, the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions and, if the arbitrator deems it appropriate, a telephonic hearing;</li>
                        <li>If the claim exceeds what can be recovered in a small claims court, the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions or a telephonic hearing, unless the arbitrator deems a face-to-face hearing is appropriate, in which case one should be held at a location agreed to by you and the Company, and if the parties cannot agree on a location for the hearing, the arbitrator will determine a location for the proceedings which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances;</li>
                        <li>The arbitrator’s ruling is binding and not merely advisory;</li>
                        <li>ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR THE COMPANY MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING;</li>
                        <li>THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING;</li>
                        <li>In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, the Company will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation;</li>
                        <li>Company also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration;</li>
                        <li>The arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law;</li>
                        <li>A decision by the arbitrator (including any finding of fact and/or conclusion of law) against either you or Company shall be confidential unless otherwise required to be disclosed by law or by any administrative body and may not be collaterally used against either of them in existing or subsequent litigation or arbitration involving any other person/Company customer; and</li>
                        <li>Each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees’ and litigation expenses.</li></ol>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Company may bring an individual action in small claims court. Further, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration provision. Such claims shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California. Additionally, notwithstanding this arbitration provision, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California in order to maintain the status quo pending the arbitrator’s ruling, and hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County, California for such purpose. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.</p>
                        <p>With the exception of subparts (iv) and (v) in the paragraph above (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, either subpart (iv) or (v) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither You nor Company shall be entitled to arbitration. In the event this arbitration provision is held unenforceable by a court, or in the event AAA refuses to arbitrate the dispute, all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and Company shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California.</p>
                        <p>For more information on AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at http://www.adr.org. The Terms and Conditions of Use is made under and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Miscellaneous
                        <p>These Terms are the entire agreement between you and Company with respect to the Site and use of the Site, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and Company with respect to the Site. If any provision of the Terms and Conditions of Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms and Conditions of Use will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Company shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Company’s reasonable control, including mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation (including “line-noise” interference). The Terms and Conditions of Use are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Company's prior written consent. Company may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights and obligations hereunder without consent. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of the Terms and Conditions of Use and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under the Terms and Conditions of Use, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys' fees. The term “including” means “including without limitation”.</p></li>
